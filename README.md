# Deep-Learning-Final-Project

This project attempts to classify architectural heritage. 
It presents a Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) that can classify architectural heritage elements into classes, such as altar, apse, bell tower, column, dome (inner), dome (outer), flying buttress, gargoyle, stained glass and vault. 

The project tries out different types of neural network architectures and hyper parameter tuning, to gain insight into what factors contribute most to model performance.
